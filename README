-- What is this?

Slocky is a simple communication framework built on top of tls for
(hopefully) secure message passing.  Messages can be any sort of json
serializable object.  The model assumes a singular central server
which some number of clients connect to.

Slocky automates the creation of the ssl key and certificate, and
[will feature] a means by which one can securly register new clients
and distribute the certificate.
